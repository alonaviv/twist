Not urgent stuff to do:
Show people the current lineup
Show people what songs they are already signed up for
Have case insensitive names of singers/songs/musicals - so if they type twice with different capitals it'll treat it the
 same.
 Change time field to be date - so after 12 it doesn't become earlier. Not sure this is true..
